# reconstructionBody

This program include 3 features: feature extraction, point cloud registration and mesh deform.

## 1.image feature extraction:

### SURF & Mesh curvature 

SURF:image feature extraction

mesh curvature: Map image feature point to vertext in mesh, and get the curvature feature. 

use these two step to filter feature points in mesh.

## 2.point cloud registration:

### initial registration

compute the transformation between two point sets by Least Square Method.

### ICP 

## 3.mesh deform
local rigid deform

# TODO
1. merge point cloud
2. remesh 
3. merge texture
4. good good study English
